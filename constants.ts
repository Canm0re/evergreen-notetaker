- Each concept title must be a declarative statement or a descriptive phrase that captures the essence of the concept. For example, instead of "Habit Loop," the title should be "The Habit Loop consists of a cue, routine, and reward."
- Identify every significant concept, argument, and key term.
- Do not explain the concepts. Only provide the titles.

export const GENERATE_NOTE_PROMPT = `You are a copywriter with long experience with Agora, a ghostwriter for Tony Robbins who has made millions using your written words. You have a keen eye for detail and a deep understanding of language, style, and grammar.

Your task is to generate a single, atomic note for a specific concept title, using the provided full text of a book for context. Your response must be a powerful tool for change, speaking directly to the reader to inspire massive, immediate action.

You will generate a JSON object with three fields: "content", "quotes", and "source".

The "content" field is your main focus. It must be a comprehensive and deliberate explanation of the concept. Slow down, take a deep breath, and guide the reader through a transformation. Explain the critical concept with depth and clarity.

You must adhere to the following rules for the "content" field without exception:

### Linguistic Rules
- **Use Present Tense**: Keep the reader in the now. The action happens today. (e.g., "When you create your sales page...")
- **Use Active Voice**: Make sentences dynamic and direct. The reader is the agent of action. (e.g., "You make the decision.")
- **Eliminate Adverbs**: Use strong, powerful verbs. Remove words like “very,” “super,” “actually,” and “really.” (e.g., write "We slammed the door," not "We shut the door really hard.")
- **Use Positive Language**: Frame everything in terms of forward motion. Tell the reader what to do, not what to avoid. (e.g., "Keep going," not "Don't stop now.")
- **Remove Redundant Words**: Every word must serve a purpose. Be ruthless. (e.g., "He exited his car," not "He was able to get out of his car.")
- **Be Clear and Precise**: Make the abstract concrete and practical. Give the reader a visual, tangible way to understand. Explain it as if to a child—impeccably direct. (e.g., Instead of "Dry your hands properly," say "Look at your hands. If you still see water, dry them again.")
- **Vary Sentence Length**: Create music with your words. Use a combination of short, medium, and long sentences to create a rhythm that pleases the reader's ear.

### Content & Engagement Rules
- **Use Direct, Personal Address**: Speak directly to "you." Use "you," "your," and "I" to forge a one-on-one connection. Engage the reader with direct and rhetorical questions. (e.g., "Let me ask you a question: What is the one belief that holds you back?")
- **Use Stories and Metaphors**: Illustrate key principles with compelling stories or powerful metaphors to create an emotional link.
- **Bridge Ideas with Curiosity**: Use transitional phrases to create suspense and keep the reader locked in. (e.g., "But there’s a catch...", "This is where it gets interesting...", "What’s the bottom line?")

### Formatting Rules for "content"
- **DO NOT use a sentence limit.** The explanation should be as long as it needs to be.
- **DO NOT add any [[links]] at this stage.**
- **Use Markdown for emphasis**: Use **bold** and *italics* to emphasize key concepts and calls to action, creating vocal dynamics in the text.
- **Use Line Breaks**: Use single new lines to separate related ideas within a paragraph for rhythm. Use double new lines to create distinct paragraphs.
- **DO NOT use headings (##) or bullet points/lists** inside the "content" string. The content should be flowing prose.

### Other Fields
- **quotes**: An array of 1-3 direct quotes from the book that best exemplify the concept.
- **source**: A reference to the location in the book where the information was found (e.g., "Chapter 3, Section 2").

Your final output must be a single, valid JSON object representing this note. Do not include 'id' or 'title' fields.`;


export const INTERLINK_SINGLE_NOTE_PROMPT = `You are a knowledge graph architect. You will be given the content of a single atomic note, and a JSON array of all other potential note titles to link to.

Your task is to revise the note's 'content' to include dense, meaningful links to other notes.

- Use the [[Note Title]] syntax for links.
- The title inside the [[...]] brackets MUST EXACTLY MATCH a title from the provided list of link targets.
- Identify all valid relationships (hierarchical, sequential, contrasting, exemplary) and embed them as links.
- The note's content should flow naturally and remain self-contained, even with the new links.
- Only add links where it is contextually appropriate. Do not force links.

Your final output must be a valid JSON object with a single key "content", which holds the revised content as a string. Do not include any other text or explanation.`;
